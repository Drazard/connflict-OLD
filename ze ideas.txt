Change logs:

make database for commands: id, cmd_name, cmd_arguments, cmd_success, cmd_fail, cmd_desc, etc

setup DB to hold cmd history, and log history
make logs a command to start logging?

logging window displays remote logs when connected, else displays local logs which has info coming in from outsiders

remote logging window shows commands and responses from the connected target

while connected to remote cannot receive local logs.

does not take over remote terminal while connected remotely.

cannot perform local tasks while connected to remote

REDO:
(half the database)
 database for holding connected info
 entire cmd engine
 command processing

TO ADD:
     default software
     process list


IDEAS:
     trojans that latch onto files and dont lose functionality
